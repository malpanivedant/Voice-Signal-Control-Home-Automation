# Voice-Signal-Control-Home-Automation
Home-Automation System that uses voice signal command to operate home appliances using bluetooth as a mode of communication and Arduino as a bridge between switches and mobile application


Our project is a voice signal controlled home automation system. First the input signal is
given by us in form of voice, that voice is converted to text by an app designed by us. This
text signal is then sent to Arduino via Bluetooth module. The output of the Arduino is the
input for the relay module which is used to control our fan and bulb.
